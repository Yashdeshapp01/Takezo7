Trusted Crowdfunding Platform Using a Smart Contract

As per trusted reports, 85% of startups delay the delivery, and 14% donâ€™t deliver at all what was promised to the angel investors. As of today, crowdfunding platforms have accountability and trust problems. In many cases, money from investors has gone into wrong campaigns and has been misused.

Implementing a blockchain-based platform can bring in a change. With blockchain technology, investors can know to whom the money is going and how they are spending it. A smart contract helps to block the funds within blockchain until the project or startup founder makes progress in the project.
